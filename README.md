# SpaceShip Titanic Project

## Abstract

The Spaceship Titanic project aims to develop a Machine Learning model to predict the chance of a space traveler being transported to a different dimension based on the passenger’s information. Currently, this model is trained on the passenger data features provided in the [Kaggle competition - Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic), and can only consider these features to make a prediction. Based on provided passenger data we can predict a passenger's chance to be transported to a different dimension with 81% accuracy. Compared to other models in Kaggle, based on accuracy our model ranks 80th in thousands of submissions. This Machine Learning Model development process can be extended to other Machine Learning datasets containing information on travel accident victims.
